# Kernel Delta Networks Project

This repository contains the implementation, experiments, and results for the Kernel Delta Networks project. The project explores a novel approach to neural network training that incorporates kernel methods and stochastic processes.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories:

```
kernel-delta-networks/
├── src/
├── notebooks/
└── results/
```

### src/

The `src/` directory contains the core implementation of the Kernel Delta Networks. It includes:

- Custom layer implementations (MovingKernelDeltaLayer, KernelDeltaLayer)
- Network architectures (MovingKernelDeltaNetwork, KernelDeltaNetwork)
- Kernel operators
- Data loaders
- Training and evaluation utilities
- Stochastic process implementations

For detailed information about the contents and usage of the `src/` directory, please refer to its [README.md](src/README.md).

### notebooks/

The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks with various experiments conducted using the Kernel Delta Networks. These notebooks demonstrate the application of the implemented methods to different tasks and datasets, and provide insights into the performance and behavior of the networks.

### results/

The `results/` directory contains:

1. PNG graphs: Visualizations of experimental results, including performance comparisons, convergence plots, and other relevant metrics.
2. Personal research notes: Detailed observations, analyses, and conclusions drawn from the experiments.

This directory serves as a repository for the outcomes of the experiments and the accompanying analysis.

## Getting Started
