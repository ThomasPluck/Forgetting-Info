Something that seems to come fairly often out of OUR-SGD (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent) is that a lot of the tests for memorization that we develop - tend to have the opposite desired effect, either they completely obstruct the models ability to learn to make the model overfit *spectacularly* well (as in 99% train accuracy, 9.8% test accuracy on MNIST - wowza).
